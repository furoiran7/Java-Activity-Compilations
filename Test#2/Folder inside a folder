Making a new folder inside a folder.

On GitHub you can do it this way:

Go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder
Click on New file
On the text field for the file name, first write the folder name you want to create
Then type /. This creates a folder
You can add more folders similarly
Finally, give the new file a name (for example, .gitkeep which is conventionally used to make Git track otherwise empty folders; it is not a Git feature though)
Finally, click Commit new file.
